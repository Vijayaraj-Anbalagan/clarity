Appropriate attire includes collared shirts, blouses, dress pants, skirts, and dresses. Jeans may be worn, provided they are not ripped or overly casual.",
          "Traditional Attire Fridays: Every Friday, we celebrate our Tamil Nadu heritage by allowing employees to wear traditional attire. Whether it’s a saree or a veshti, we take pride in showcasing our culture at the workplace. This not only adds a touch of cultural pride to our work environment but also fosters a sense of unity and belonging among the team.",
          "Internet and Workspace Requirements: Employees opting for remote work must provide proof of a stable internet connection to ensure seamless communication and productivity. Additionally, your workspace should be quiet and free from distractions. We encourage remote employees to create a dedicated workspace that helps them stay focused and productive.",
          "Daily Work Reports: To maintain accountability and transparency, remote employees must log their daily work reports. This helps managers keep track of progress and address any challenges promptly. Regular check-ins with your manager will also be scheduled to ensure alignment on project goals and timelines.",
          "Fire Drills: Safety is a top priority at Social Sync. Fire drills are conducted quarterly to ensure all employees are familiar with emergency procedures. Employees are encouraged to actively participate and take note of exit routes and emergency protocols. We also provide training on the proper use of fire extinguishers and other safety equipment.",

Please inform your manager and HR in advance if you need transportation support. We also have a buddy system in place, where employees can leave the office together for added security."
